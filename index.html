                <p>I've received a number of emails from users having trouble extracting files from <i>team fortress 2
                    content.gcf</i>. It's taken eight years, but with the advent of the <a

                    Scream Fortress</a>, Valve have finally authored a GCF file larger than 4 GB. As many of you have
                  found out, <a href="pages/Miscellaneous-HLLib.html">HLLib</a>
                  does not properly support files larger than 4 GB (partly due to my naive younger self, and partly
                  because I wasn't sure if Steam did either).</p>

                <p>Long story short, I updated HLLib to support files larger than 4 GB tonight, and I will release said
                  update this weekend when I have time to build all the installers and more thoroughly test everything.
                </p>

                <p>Happy Halloween!</p>

                  still built for Visual Studio 2005. I also removed .Net 1.1 support (the framework was buggy and did
                  not support x64).</p>

                <p>It's been over 6 years since I first released <a href="pages/GCFScape.html">GCFScape</a>,
                  so I though I'd take some time this weekend to bring it up to speed. <a

                  introduces native x64 support and fixes a lot of incorrect assumptions that lead to less than
                  desirable behavior on Windows Vista and Windows 7.</p>

                <p>v1.8.0 targets the .Net Framework 2.0, so anything up to and including 3.5 should work. You may,
                  however, have to install the Visual C++ 2008 SP1 library.</p>

                <p>Some of you may have noticed a number of issues with this site lately (aside from the routine DNS
                  issues). The server is currently having problems with SQL queries that require disk storage. As a
                  temporary measure, I've written fallback SQL queries. For the most part, the site seems to be
                  functioning better now, with only a few minor issues such as unsorted menu items and missing comment
                  counts.</p>

                <p>There is still the underlying issue: what happened to <a
                    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200201043948/http://www.thewavelength.net/">The Wavelength</a>?
                  Currently the website says that the account has been suspended. I've tried to contact Bulk (the owner)
                  without success. Unfortunately, there is the very real possibility that this site, in its current
                  form, may cease at any moment.</p>

                <p>In the mean time, I've added a new tool for Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 programmers. Check it out <a

                <p>Valve have decided to move away from the .gcf format for their new game <a
                    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200201043948/http://www.l4d.com/">Left 4 dead</a>. Instead, the
                  game is delivered via .ncf with materials, models and particles packed up in a new .vpk package
                  format. I'm curious if this move was inspired by the performance problems caused by fragmented .gcf
                  files. Nonetheless, I've updated both <a href="pages/Miscellaneous-HLLib.html">HLLib</a>
                  and <a href="pages/GCFScape.html">GCFScape</a>
                  with support for the new .vpk format.</p>

                <p>I'm also in the process of looking to add support for Left 4 Dead to Crafty. Early attempts look
                  promising, I just hope the model format hasn't changed too much.</p>

                <p>I haven't had a lot of opportunities to work on my tools these past few months, but today I finally

                <p>Anyone sniffing around the recent Team Fortress 2 preload may have noticed that many of the preloaded
                  VTF files are of a new version. As part of refinements being made to the Source engine, Team Fortress
                  2 and Half-Life 2: Episode 2 will introduce v7.3 of the VTF format, a minor overhaul exposing an
                  extensible resource interface.</p>

                <p>For those interested in taking a gander, I've added support for the new VTF version to <a

                <p>I've released v1.0.0 Alpha 13 of <a href="pages/Crafty.html">Crafty</a>,
                  a release which adds several <a
                    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200201043948/http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?c=222#p222">missing
                    features</a> bringing Crafty significantly closer to leaving the alpha stage. The latest build can
                  be found <a href="pages/Crafty-Download.html">here</a>.
                  Some important notes:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Due to changes in the lightmap generation code for Source VBSP files, upgrading users should make
                    sure to set the <i><b>Gamma</b></i> for Source VBSP files to <i><b>2.2</b></i> in Object Viewer's
                    Options (found under the <i>Setup</i> menu).</li>
                  <li>Users who were experiencing problems with fonts should insure that the
                    <i><b>Engine.FontDriver</b></i> setting in Object Viewer's INI file (<i>ov.ini</i>) is set to
                    <i><b>Sprite</b></i>, or, as a last resort, <i>Null</i>. If you cannot find this setting, run Object
                    Viewer once beforehand.</li>
                  <li><i>Dynamic Lighting</i> is very much a work in progress. I've added shader support to Crafty to
                    better simulate how the Source engine dynamically lights models, but the improved dynamic lighting
                    pipeline wont be available unto the next release.</li>

                <p>I realize I haven't updated my site in a while, so I thought I'd take a minute to let all of you who
                  have made feature requests over the past few months know that I haven't forgotten about you. So just
                  what have I been up to?</p>

                <p>First and foremost, I've released version 1.6.3 of <a href="pages/GCFScape.html">GCFScape</a>.
                  This new version features configurable columns for viewing additional properties, removal of the File
                  Mapping requirement for defragmenting GCF files (to prevent an overzealous Windows from caching the
                  entire file) and relaxed GCF file integrity checks; all community requested features. As always it can
                  be found <a href="pages/GCFScape-Download.html">here</a>.
                </p>

                <p>Lastly, I've been hard at work on <a href="pages/Crafty.html">Crafty</a>,
                  implementing the dozen or so features that have been requested. Unfortunately, I bit off a little more
                  than I can chew which means the next release is still a few weeks off (and rapidly approaching the
                  feature set I'm looking for to take it out of alpha). VBSP upgrades include cloud shaders, fog
                  entities, dynamic lighting, improved 3D skybox support and corrected lightmaps (still not <i>quite</i>
                  right):</p>
