                somewhere already?<br>I did typedef char* string; and my prog compiled but I suspect that isn't how it
                is supposed to be done. <br>When you say "An int followed by an ASCII char array, no null terminator."
                do you mean the int stores the length of the char array, maybe like:<br>struct string<br>{<br> int
                length;<br> char[] txt;<br>

                i was reading the texture area of a file and there seems to be a lot more TGFace items than i thought. I
                was assuming that there were 2 TGFace items in the array for every square created by the grid of points.
                I kept reading more and more than that trying to find the end of the file and there was way more than I
                expected. Thanks for your help.</div>

                Header300.YSize vertices and (Header300.XSize - 1) * (Header300.YSize - 1) faces. If you only want the
                height data, then you only need to read the first vertex section, if you want the texture data, you have
                to read the second face section. To interpret the second section, think of the terrain consisting of
                strips of quads; there is one face per quad.</div>

              </div>
              <div class="content">here's the code when i assumed the faces were triangles, 2 per quad, which is twice
                as many as what you are saying:<br><br>[code]<br> int numtriangles = 2 * (m_Header-&gt;XSize-1) *
                (m_Header-&gt;YSize-1);<br> m_Faces = new TGFace[numtriangles];<br> for (i=0; i &lt; numtriangles;
                i++)<br> {<br> fread(&amp;iStrLength, sizeof(int), 1, pFile);<br> m_Faces[i].Texture.length =
                iStrLength;<br> m_Faces[i].Texture.txt = new char[iStrLength];<br> fread(&amp;m_Faces[i].Texture.txt,
                sizeof(char), iStrLength, pFile);<br> //m_Faces[i].Texture.txt[iStrLength+1] = "\0";<br>
                fread(&amp;m_Faces[i].Shift, sizeof(Vertex2f), 1, pFile);<br> fread(&amp;m_Faces[i].Scale,
                sizeof(Vertex2f), 1, pFile);<br> fread(&amp;m_Faces[i].Rotation, sizeof(float), 1, pFile);<br> printf
                ("%f %f\n",m_Faces[i].Rotation,m_Faces[i].Rotation);<br> printf ("%s\n",m_Faces[i].Texture.txt);<br>
                }<br> printf ("%d %d",numverts, i);<br>[/code]<br>
                I'm testing with a 121 point (11 x 11) file, and the value of "i" at the end prints 200.<br>
                <br>
                I should have definitely faulted or reached EOF, but it doesn't. I even went higher than numtriangles
                iterations, and it still didn't fault. <br>
                <br>
                This code is from right after reading the vertex info which i verified was read correctly and
                completely. <br>
                The values printed by the printf for Shift,Scale, and Rotation are all zero's (as opposed to random
                garbage). <br>
                The texture printf prints a blank.<br>
                <br>
                Also, i never assigned a texture to my test file (or even loaded a wad)., which may have something to do
                with it.<br>
                <br>
                I'm basically confused how come the file seems to be so much bigger than it should be.<br>
                <br>

                This may have been discussed elsewhere on the site, but does TG have the ability to increase/decrease
                number of points while keeping height info intact? And also, can TG clip parts of a terrain (and/or
                paste or save them somewhere)?<br>
                <br>
                I played with TG a little, but not completely and i didn't see anything like this.<br>

              </div>
              <div class="content">i wrote a console program which does things to the terrain files. Here's the README.
                Let me know if you want it posted here and/or if you want the code posted here. The repointing part
                isn't perfect, but it's not bad.<br><br>here's the readme:<br>
                <div class="vbtitle">readme:</div>
                <div class="vbquote"><br>This program splits, scales, and/or adds/subtracts points from files created by
                  Nem's excellent terrain generator.<br><br>You should back up any files you don't want modified/lost
                  and/or read this whole thing before you use this.<br><br>This program is written in c++ and currently
                  only runs properly on linux, bsd, etc but not on windows, I believe because of different
                  implementations of "strtok". It builds on windows, and is so close to running, but alas I got fed up
                  with it, and it dogged me. It needs to run on windows bad because that is where the actual terrain
                  generator made by Nem runs. If anybody can fix this and get it to run on windows, that would be so
                  freaking awesome. It should be simple for anybody familiar with processing strings in c++ (which I
                  ain't). The bug is in main.cpp in the function LoadConfigFile where the config file is being read to
                  load the commands.<br><br>Also, this program isn't super user-friendly, as in if you specify the wrong
                  file on the command line or don't pass in the correct number or type of parameters in the config file,
                  it will simply crash without telling you anything in most cases (sometimes writing a giant core dump
                  file, if you have core dumps turned on). So if that happens, you need to go back and scrutinize all
                  your spelling, number of parameters, etc.<br><br>This program is run on the command line
                  like:<br>tgmanip filename<br>or<br>tgmanip filename &lt;configfile&gt;<br><br>"filename" is the name
                  of your terrain file, and &lt;configfile&gt; is the name of the file that tells the program what to
                  do.<br>If the program is run without specifying a config file, the program will look for a file in the
                  same directory as the terrain file with the same name but with a .cfg extension instead. If it can't
                  find a config file to use, it won't run.<br>If your paths have spaces in them, use quotes.<br><br>The
                  commands in the config file are:<br>split &lt;numbercolumns&gt; [&lt;numberrows&gt;]<br>scale
                  [sections] &lt;factor&gt; [&lt;scaleZ&gt;]<br>repoint [sections] &lt;factor&gt;<br>scroll
                  &lt;xfactor&gt; &lt;yfactor&gt;<br>rotate &lt;number of quarter turns in counterclockwise
                  direction&gt;<br>join &lt;filename1&gt; &lt;filename2&gt; &lt;vertically&gt;<br><br>Note the special
                  word: sections.<br><br>"split" will split the terrain into &lt;numbercolumns&gt; * &lt;numberrows&gt;
                  new files (without changing the original) which are the sections of the original. If
                  &lt;numberrows&gt; is omitted, then it will be the same as &lt;numbercolumns&gt;.<br><br>"scale" is
                  pretty obvious. Pass in a number. The number 1 would keep the same scale. Negative numbers will mirror
                  it twice, which essentially just rotates it 180 degrees. If the parameter &lt;scaleZ&gt; is not 0 or
                  omitted, then the heights will scale, otherwise they'll remain the same.<br><br>"repoint" multiplies
                  the current number of quads along the x axis times &lt;factor&gt; to come up with the new number of
                  quads along the x axis while maintaining the same size terrain. So again, giving it 1 will keep it the
                  same. Specifying a number less than 1 will subtract information from the terrain. Working with
                  rectangular (as opposed to perfectly square) grids can possibly result in a loss of information (a
                  strip across the top of the grid) if the resulting new quad size doesn't divide perfectly into the
                  overall height (y axis) of the grid.<br>The algorithm for figuring out the z values of the new points
                  isn't very sophisticated (ie doesn't use calculus) or psychic (not sure if calculus would help), it
                  only looks good if you repoint by a factor of 2 at a time. See below for good workaround. If somebody
                  can figure this out, that would be awesome.<br><br>"scroll" will scroll the terrain by &lt;xfactor&gt;
                  along the x axis and by &lt;yfactor&gt; along the y axis. A factor of 1 makes it scroll all the way
                  around and end up where it began, essentially doing nothing, which is what should be done (instead of
                  specifying 0) if you don't want it scrolled any in that particular direction.<br><br>"rotate" will
                  rotate the terrain by 90 degrees in the counterclockwise direction for every quarter turn
                  specified.<br><br>"join" takes 2 terrain files and joins them together into 1 terrain file. If
                  &lt;vertically&gt; is 0, the terrains will be joined side by side, otherwise they will be one above
                  the other (along the y axis). The resulting file does not have to exist beforehand and will be named
                  the same as the config file except with a .tgm extension. See below.<br><br><br>If you put the word
                  "sections" after a command, it does the command to all the sections (without modifying the original).
                  Otherwise it will modify the original.<br>There must already be a "split" command before specifying
                  "sections" in any commands. Also, the program doesn't support recursively splitting sections (unless
                  you manually run it again).<br></div><br>Examples for a config file:<br>
                <div class="vbtitle">Code:</div>
                <div class="vbcode"><br># pound sign is for comments in the config file<br><br># simply add more detail
                  to the original -<br># Doing a repoint to add more detail with any value other than 2 makes it look
                  wacked,<br># so if you want more detail than twice as much (like 4 times as much), simply call<br>#
                  "repoint 2" twice<br>repoint 2<br>repoint 2<br><br># split the file into 16 new files, scale them all
                  out to be bigger without scaling the height, add lots more detail to all of them<br>split 4 4<br>scale
                  sections 2 0<br>repoint sections 2<br>repoint sections 2<br>repoint sections 2<br><br># split a
                  terrain across the center horizontally into 2 pieces<br>split 1 2<br><br># scroll a terrain 30% to the
                  right, but not at all up and down<br>scroll .3 1<br><br># scroll all the newly made sections 50% in
                  both axes (don't know why you would want this)<br>scroll sections .5 .5<br><br># rotate a terrain 270
                  degrees (3 quarter turns to the left)<br>rotate 3<br><br># join 2 files side by side<br>join
                  foothills.tgm bigassmountain.tgm 0<br><br># or vertically<br>join foothills.tgm bigassmountain.tgm
                  1<br><br># the resulting terrain file will be named the same as the config file (with a .tgm
                  extension) that<br># the join command is in even if the terrain file doesn't exist yet. So you would
                  make for example a config<br># file named "joined.cfg" and on the command line say:<br># tgmanip
                  joined.tgm<br># even though the file "joined.tgm" doesn't exist yet.<br></div>

                place in a few days or so. If you want some of the code to incorporate into TG lemme know and i'll

                managed to get as far as I did. <br>
                <br>
                There is a problem with my program. I developed it on linux, where it works fine, but the part that
                parses the config file for instructions is broken on the windows build due to (I strongly suspect)
                different implementations of the function "strtok" between the windows version of c++ and the linux
                version. String manipulating/parsing in c++ for me is a frustrating bitch. <br>
                <br>
                I tried to tweak it so it wouldn't seg fault on the windows build, but I started pulling my hair out
                real soon so i said "fuggit". I'll probably retry soon though because I'm kind of getting tired of
                transferring giant files all the time.<br>
                <br>
                I've added scrolling, but got sidetracked from adding concatenating and rotating, so here's what I might
                can do:<br>
                I can post everything I have somewhere, work on rotating and concatenating, and maybe some helpful soul
                in the meantime will fix the string parsing thing on windows.</div>
