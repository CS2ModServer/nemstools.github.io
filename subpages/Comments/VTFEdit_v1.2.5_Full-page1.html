              <div class="content">The default settings <i>should</i> work (as long as your .tga has an alpha channel).
                My recommended spray settings are:<br><br>Normal Format: DXT1 - This is a compressed RGB format that
                VTFEdit will use if your texture <i>doesn't</i> have an alpha channel.<br><br>Alpha Format: DXT5 or DXT3
                - This is a compressed RGBA format that VTFEdit will use if your texture <i>has</i> an alpha channel.
                Use DXT5 if your alpha channel is smooth or DXT3 if your alpha channel is sharp (i.e. you're alpha
                channel is only there so your spray can be non-square - so its 0 or 255).<br>
                <br>
                Generate Mipamps: Unchecked. Sprays look best when you don't use mipmaps because they aren't LOD scaled.
                This will also allow you to generate larger animated textures because it uses less memory.<br>
                <br>
                If VTFEdit is not generating an alpha channel then your .tga doesn't have an alpha channel. If you're
                using PhotoShop, make sure you only have one layer when you export, and that this layer has an alpha
                channel (you can add channels in the channels tab).</div>

                have to edit the crosshair's .vmt file to add the <i>AnimatedTexture</i> proxy. If you created a new
                crosshair, then I think you also have to use the <i>cl_crosshair_file</i> console command to select it.

                Case: I have animated transparent gif with unequal uneven sizes and import causes obligatory resize
                corrupting image. It would be much better if a program allowed to put original image unchanged in a
                center of square of greater power of 2.<br />
                <br />
                Of course, resizing can be performed manually, though it'll require some specific tool to resize
                animated gif, I suppose.</div>

                is 256x256 and is a tga file (32-bit compression). I've done it once or twice but can't remember now.
                Thanks again for all you work :D</div>

              <div class="content">When I import multiple impages, using the CTRL key to select them, I select them in
                the order I want them to appear in the final animated .vtf file. Often, VTFEdit will rearrange them into
                a different sequence and I cant seem to find the pattern. I've tried various naming schemes hoping
                numeric order would override VTFEdits &quot;sequencing choices&quot; but it doesnt seem to affect it
                much. The files I was working with were .jpgs and .pngs and the problem didnt seem related to either of
                the files types or any mixture of them. <br />
                <br />
                To be clearer, I select files 1-6 in order, 1,2,3,4, etc. After I choose my resize options,etc. and
                VTFEdit imports the files, the images might be in 6,1,2,3,4,5 or 1,6,2,3,4,5.. The rearranging usually
                happens to the first or last image in the sequence. <br />

                Thoughts?<br />
                <br />
                ps. I have noticed that the file I want to be the first in the list has to be the last one chosen.<br />

                have on my list nor their names, the last one always becomes the first one. I tried to manually fix the
                problem by typing their names in the correct order but the interface doesn't allow me to type more than
                260 chars; so clicking on items seems to be the only way to select a large number of items. This is
                particularly problematic in my case because I'm using this material in a special entity that doesn't
                cycle through all the frames.<br />
                I guess one simple solution for that problem would be adding an option like &quot;import from a list
                file&quot;, in the file menu, where the user would point a .txt file with the names of all the frames in
                the proper order. What about that Nem?<img

                sonicanatidae's example, you can just select 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (temporarily selected as 6, 2, 3, 4, 5) and
                then selecting 1 to have the correct result. That worked for me.<br />

              <div class="content">Need some help guys, I am modfying uniform files in the new Kuma War 2. I have opened
                the existing vtf files and exported the contents to png and jpg. I then have used fireworks to edit the
                images flattening the layers when I was done. I did not modify the image size or any other attributes. I
                then re-imported the completed graphic into vtfmod and then save it out under the original file name.
                <br />
                <br />
                After loading them back into the client software and entering the game only the german version I did
                worked. The US uniforms now are invisible on the parts I edited. Anyone ever ran into this when editing
                an existing vtf in HL2 engines? <br />
                <br />
                If someone could point me to my flaw I would appreciate any help you can give. Oh and P.S. I set the
                transparency to Alpha in the completed image files.<br />

                it doesn't work as they just use the same image over and over to delay it that way which sucks.

                No, no. VTFEdit works fine, and using the proxy method of modifying the VTF's animation speed via the
                VMT file works fine as well. You can even see this when you look at it from within TF2's multiplayer
                options. It animates as you would expect a normal VTF texture to animate.<br />
                <br />
                The issue here is that Valve has chosen to limit the VTF format with respect to sprays and sprays ONLY.
                If you were creating the VTF for use on a player model, or a wall texture, or whatever else, it would
                abide by the settings put forth in the VMT file. However, these limits imposed upon the sprays means
                that the spray will be displayed one way, and one way ONLY.<br />
                <br />
                This helps to keep (cheaters, I guess?) people from modifying it in such a way that may give them an
                advantage.. Because of these limits, the spray will animate at a set speed, you cannot tell the spray to
                ignore the z stacking order, or influence the way the spray is affected by lighting, etc. etc. It is set
                up to be a single-use option, so really nothing you put into the VMT will be honored by the game. The
                only reason it needs a VMT is so that it can display properly in the GUI. Once you use it as a spray on
                a surface, it's applying its own set attributes to the texture.<br />
                <br />
                I hope this helps. :)
