              <div class="content"><b>About:</b>
                <p>BSP Viewer is a utility designed for mappers for previewing Half-Life 1 .bsp files and technical
                  information about how they are being rendered. This is meant to help mappers find problem areas in
                  their BSP files that need to be optimized.</p>

                <p>BSP Viewer has been superseded by Crafty, my new Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2 .bsp, .gl, .map, .mdl,
                  .rmf and .vmf viewer. Crafty can be found <a href="../../pages/Crafty.html">here</a>.

              <div class="content">I use it because I prefer to write C++ code, and managed .NET code can interop
                transparently with unmanaged C++ code. This means I can write &quot;normal&quot; C++ code and still take
                advantage of the .NET framework which I use mainly for its ability to write complex user interfaces with
                very little effort (as well as other services like cryptology and networking).<br />
                <br />
                As for your points:<br />
                Unmanaged code C++ does not use the garbage collector.<br />
                <br />
                Upgrading C++ code from v1.1 to v2.0 is a HUGE pain in the ass (hopefully this will not reoccur in
                v3.0).<br />
                <br />
                Managed C++ is not platform independent, only purely managed code is (C# and VB); unfortunately most my
                code is locked to Windows, though my unmanaged C++ code (which makes up the core of most projects) can

                more advanced than Hammer's function (allows you to search by keys or values on their own or as KV
                pairs, and supports partial matches). Would be nice (but not essential) it you could right click on keys
                or values in the lower-left pane and it would give you the option to automatically search for say a
                target field.<br />
                <br />
                Also when you click on an entity in the list, its hard to find it in the 3d view. Because the thin
                orange lines used to highlight an entity don't stand out too well. There should be a setting to control
                the thickness and colour of these lines, should be pretty simple to do and it would solve the problem
                nicely :)<br />

                And finally, the draw distance should be increased to at least 14200 so that you can see everything,

              <div class="content">Well yes, I can import the map files into hammer. But it takes a bit of trickery.
                When you export the map file you add a bunch of useless spaces,<br />ie,<br />
                <div class="vbtitle">Code:</div>

                <br />
                <br />
                Which hammer and MapFool cannot read, I have to go in and replace all double spaces with nothing to end
                up with this:<br />
                <br />
                {<br />
                }<br />
                (28238483 34342 2233) etc<br />
                (etc)<br />
                }<br />
                }<br />
                <br />
                I use Map Fool to be able to process the textures into vmf's so I look at the map in hammer not grey
                walls. <br />
                <br />
                But the main problem is that when you export the map files you take all the solids and hollow them all
                by 1 unit. So a simple block becomes a 6 faced cube with 1 unit thick walls... <br />
                <br />
                I know that all decompilers do this, but I was using your program and I looks at the walls your BSP
                class generates and they are solid, not made of numerous 1 unit thick walls. And I can not help thinking
                that somewhere in your program, instead of making the map file solids off of the right, display size
                solids, you are taking the real solids and making them 6 faces 1 unit hollowed blocks. Or you are read
                straight from the bsp and not from the nice map you build in the program. <br />
                In either case, I find it extremly frustrating.<br />
                <br />
                In hammer, it does not build map files created by decompilers such as bsp2map and this because of all
                the solids that insect (tjuncs), which are created by the 1 unit thick walls. What we have to do to
                convert maps is first get the map file, load it into hammer, and before we can even compile it to look
                around we have resize all the walls to replace the 6 1 unit thick blocks with 1 solid block. <br />

                process destroys the brushes you see in Hammer (or whatever editor you use) and converts them into a
                polygon soup. This process is NOT reversible. A brush (in Hammer) is a convex collection of planes that,
                when intersected, form polygons. When these planes are removed or split by the CSG process, the original
                brush is gone forever. BSP Viewer's approach is to say to hell with the brushes and construct a new
                brush for each face in the BSP (hence the 1 unit brushes). Other programs (such as <a
                  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180414014122/http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/WinBSPC">WinBSPC</a>)
                construct one large brush that engulfs the entire world, then &quot;hollow&quot; it out subtracting the
                BSP geometry and breaking up the brush into smaller convex brushes. This process creates more
                &quot;brush like&quot; results, but is still nothing close to how one would actually map.<br />
                <br />
                This is why there are no good BSP decompilers, it is a really hard problem to solve. Half-Life 2 has a
                better BSP decompiler (VMEX) but only because the original brushes are stored in the BSP along with the
                CSG polygon soup.</div>

              <div class="content">Yes I understand now, I read some of your comments on the Map file Format on VERC and
                looked at the source. <br />
                <br />
                I understand that what you are doing is reading the bsp, constructing the normals and distances, etc,
                and building a brush. However, I do see an approach that can make good map files.<br />
                <br />
                What I realized from looking at these map files you generate is that each section describes a face, not
                a brush. So when hammer loads it I assume it screws with it and forces it to be atleast 1 unit thick and
                then it interects with the other 'faces' you wrote to the map file. But why not do this instead of
                writing faces as if they were brushes.<br />
                <br />
                You have good solids inside your program, and I know that the map file format is to read three points
                from the line, generate a normal and distance to get a plane, which it then used with the other 5 lines
                to calculate a volumn for the total brush. Your program does this, but when saving the map file it saves
                each face as a brush, with each face getting its own 6 line segment in the map file. <br />
                Why not instead, forget the original bsp, and make the map file off of your displayed map. For instance,
                I am not 100% sure on the process yet, but take a face on one of the solids, define three points
                somewhere on it, and write that line to the map file. Then move onto the next face, define three points
                on it, then write the next line. And do that for all 6 lines on a segment. That way when hammer goes to
                make the normals and planes, one brush is defined by 1 segment instead of 6, which causes the 1 unit
                thick walls.<br />
                <br />
                Now that I know whats up, I downloaded your map view source, and though I will have a much harder time
                trying to convert a 6 segment solid into a 1 segment solid, I am going to start trying to write a
                program that will do it. It might take some tinkering, but I a sure that when a program that actually
                makes solids instead of faces will become imensly popular. I know me and my mod crew will use it a lot.
                <br />
                <br />
                Which by the way, in your map view source, there is a typo.<br />
                In the MapViewer.rc file you incude resource2.h, and not resource.h which is what exsists, Resource2
                doesnt. If doesnt compile right off the bat, but when I changed the MapViewer.rc file it worked.</div>

                Brushes, by nature, must be <a
                  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180414014122/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex">convex</a>. But
                BSPs contain a polygon soup which is anything but convex. The only logical grouping of faces in a BSP is
                into leaf-nodes, which are collections of near by faces. However, these leaf-nodes are concave by nature
                and so can't be used to construct a brush. It's not just a matter of taking a bunch of faces and
                combining them into a brush, therein lies the problem!<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                BTW, MAP Viewer's source is old and quite poor.</div>

              </div>
              <div class="content">I know that going from bsp to map is difficult, and most decompilers fail with their
                1 unit walls. I discovered that what they are doing is describing each face in the map file. The regular
                map file format is supposed to start with a {, then go for 6 lines in which is describes 6 faces for a
                solid. Then when it loads the map it finds the normal, dot product, etc, you know all
                this.<br /><br />What you and other decompilers do is instead of using those 6 lines to describe a full
                solid (like a wall) you use these sections, denoted by the {}'s to describe each face. So instead of
                this:<br /><br />
                <div class="vbtitle">Code:</div>
                <div class="vbcode"><br />{<br />(a face)<br />(a face)<br />(a face)<br />(a face)<br />(a
                  face)<br />(a face)<br />}<br /></div><br /><br />you generate this:<br /><br />
                <div class="vbtitle">Code:</div>
                <div class="vbcode"><br />{<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a
                  face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />}<br />{<br />(a
                  face of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face
                  of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />}<br />{<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a
                  face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a
                  face)<br />}<br />{<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a
                  face of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />(a face of a face)<br />}<br />etc..<br /></div><br />
                <br />
                And together these 6 sections you create actually represent one solid. So in hammer's eyes it seems like
                you are creating numerous solids to build a solid. Instead of numerous faces to make a face.<br />
                <br />
                I do not know if I can explain it better :( But thats sort of not important.<br />
                <br />
                What I get, is that going from bsp to map is very hard.<br />
                But what I see is you creating a 3d world with the bsp.<br />
                A 3d world with vertices and planes and solid walls<br />
                <br />
                So what I am saying is that instead of going bsp to map, go bsp to 3d world to map.<br />
                <br />
                Use the coords you can pick up off of the display to go backwards through the vector normalize/dot
                product loop you described in VERC<br />

              <div class="content">Well you clearly understand the problem, but the solution is a lot harder that simply
                combining the faces.<br />
                <br />
                Consider a single brush crate. If this brush was made an entity then yes, all six faces of the bush
                would be present in the BSP and you could easily construct one brush for the decompiled faces. However,
                if the crate is on the ground and a world brush, it would only have five faces, and it if was also
                against a wall, it would only have four, and if it was also in a corner, it would only have three, and
                if it also had another crate on top of it, it would only have two. Ignoring the fact that it is hard to
                know which faces make up the crate, in each case where there is a face missing, there are infinitely
                many ways to add faces to create a brush, and adding these faces must be done in such a way that doesn't
                protrude into the BSP (and makes sense). A lot of the time brushes are reduced to just one face in the
                BSP.<br />
                <br />
                This brings us to the other problem. How do you know which faces should be part of a brush if they exist
                in a polygon soup? There is no way to know. You can estimate by checking proximity and whether or not
                combining faces results in a convex solid, but it is still a tricky problem.<br />
                <br />
                Furthermore, the faces in a BSP are even more mangled by because they are split by other geometry and to
                produce smaller concave nodes (think of how a staircase splits up). These faces must be reunited in a
                convex manor, but again there are many ways of doing this.<br />
                <br />
                I'm not trying to deter you from trying, I'm just trying to make sure you understand the problem and why
                I have never spent a lot of time trying to get BSP Viewer to export usable MAP files. Good luck!<br />

                different projects and other garbage I thought was done a long time ago.. <br />
                <br />
                I will continue thinking about it and maybe contributing tio a program little by little. I hate having
                my mappers go through and move all the walls from being 6 faces 1 unit hollow brushes to full walls.
                Thats why I asked. Your program seemed to do a very good job of constructing the solids. <br />
                <br />
                I am still debating, I am not sure which is easier, a program that will read bad map files and convert
                them, or a program that will read 3d vertices from your 3d view and construct brushes off of that..
                <br />
                <br />
                I really like that hollowing idea that you told me about, I decompiled a few maps with that program and
                got considerably better results. Its just to bad it doesn't work for most maps.</div>

                I really like bsb viewer. sometimes when loading one of the half-life single player maps(HLSP). using a
                pak0 everything is gray. so i just use the half-life.gcf then the map looks normal.<br />
                <br />
                things like func_monsterclip, trigger_once and trigger_changelevel often have some weird texture applied
                to them? I have to fly through them to see the rest of the map.<br />
                <br />
                now to the question: do you have a spawn point tool? Kinda like bsb viewer where I could fly to the spot
                where I want to put a spawn point and have a player model show up where each spawn point is.<br />
                <br />
                if no, do you know of one? have used spawnpointeditor 1.3 by Michael.A.C.Pink<br />
                It has some utility but the wire frame display of the map. makes it hard to add multiple spawn points.
                very difficult on the HLSP maps where things can be kind of tight.</div>

              <div class="content">Found another use for this old tool, getting a old HL1 .bsp to VMF in the latest
                hammer.<br /><br />Some old maps decompile with decompilers and some don't, some have a lot of invalid
                structures and hammer will not open them, some do.<br /><br />If you find nothing else works to get the
                old structure of a .bsp, try this....<br /><br />The BSPViewer and Crafty .bsp to .map then to .vmf
                Method:<br /><br />1. With BSPViewer. Open the .bsp file, go to &quot;File&quot; and Export select
                &quot;MAP File&quot;, un-tick &quot;Bevel Brushes&quot; and &quot;Use Null textures&quot; OK and give it
                a name, save as a .map.<br /><br />2. Now open that saved file with Crafty, select &quot;File&quot; and
                &quot;Export&quot;, drop down the &quot;Save as Type&quot; select VMF, give it a name.<br /><br />Open
                the VMF with Hammer, it may give an error about could not load some solids, just continue without them,
                (press &quot;Yes&quot;) it will look nuts, all orange and heaps of 1 unit walls.<br /><br />If you now
                go to the &quot;VisGroups&quot; and un-tick World Geometry what you may end up with are some structures
                like trees, tables, chairs, arches without a heap of walls in the way. These are Brush entities, that
                may be enough to start to build a source map from the old structure and have it very close to the same
                layout.<br /><br />I know there are easy ways, <u>this is only for HL1 maps that you keep getting
                  crashes when trying to open a decompliled .map or .vmf</u>, seems to get rid of a few bad eggs in the
                file.<br />
