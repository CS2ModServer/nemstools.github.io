							<div class="content"><b>About:</b>

								<p>VTFLib is a LGPL open source programming library, written by <a href="http://www.wunderboy.org/">Neil
										Jedrzejewski</a>
									and I. VTFLib provides a C and C++ API that, with a few simple functions, can open and save .vtf and
									.vmt files, providing access to all known features. The library functions independent of Steam,
									allowing third party applications to use the library without Steam present or runningi on the target
									system.</p>

								<p>VTFLib includes two GPL example applications, VTFCmd and VTFEdit. VTFCmd is a C command line frontend
									for VTFLib that can create .vtf and .vmt files from various source formats. It is similar in
									functionality to Valve's vtex Source SDK utility, but offers a lot more control. VTFEdit is a C++ .NET
									graphical frontend for VTFLib with viewing and creation capabilities. Both VTFCmd and VTFEdit support
									several source image formats, including, but not limited to .bmp, .dds, .gif, .jpg, .png and .tga.</p>

								You have right, because bsptwomap for Quake 3. Map File doesn't support for Half-Life, because map was
								problematic on the Valve Hammer Edition. I see bad decompiler, because we need bsptwormf like bsptwovmf.
								Because Rmf was correct file for correct blocks and showing clip, null, orgin, skip and hill blocks
								support working. In the decompilrd map files do not show special textures (null, clip and more...)
								blocks. That problem of bsptwomap deleted special texture-blocks.. <img

							<div class="content">Hi sorry if this sound a bit dum .. but I have been using hammer for mapping for half
								life 2 death match now for some time. Now i need to seriously start creating my own textures and have
								started to use vtf edit.<br />
								My problem is that if I allow vtf edit to create mipmaps the texture in hammer and in game looks really
								crap and basically degrades the further away you are from the wall or texture. If i turn off the mip
								maps the texture will look great in hammer and in the game BUT the thumbnail in hammer where you select
								your texture basically gets mixed up with other thumbnails and gets distorted making it harder to make
								your texture choice when you have allot of them. also I cant find an option to reduce the number of mip
								maps from 9.<br />
								<br />
								I had thought that if I reduced the mipmaps to say 1 that the thumb nail would return to its proper look
								and the in game texture would also still look good.<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Do you have any help please or sujestion.... Also is there a tutorial on how to use vtf edit for texture
								creation please.</div>

							<div class="content">It's interesting that you say mipmapping makes your textures look worse because one
								of the purposes of mipmaps is to improve the visual quality of the scene. There are a few cases where
								mipmaps aren't much help (e.g. weapon skins) but for the most part you should generate
								them.<br /><br />I suggest you play around with the mipmap settings in VTFEdit. For general textures I
								recommend the <i>Sine Cardinal</i> mipmap filter (as it is closest to the filter vtex uses); however,
								the <i>Box</i> mipmap filter may work better in some situations. If you find your mipmaps are too
								blurry, you may try a sharpen filter (otherwise set the sharpen filter to <i>None</i>). Of the sharpen
								filters, <i>Unsharpen Mask</i> is probably the best. There are additional options for this filter under
								the advanced tab. Decrease the amount to decrease the amount of sharpening.<br /><br />The same settings
								don't always work best for all types of textures, but you should find ones that work. It can be a good
								idea to generate your texture multiple times with different settings and examine the resulting mipmaps
								in VTFEdit.<br /><br />Lastly, if you have a somewhat recent video card, you may want to make sure
								you're using a good filter in game. Typically this will be the highest <a
									href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170904164308/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropic_filtering">anisotropic</a>
								setting your video card supports.</div>

							<div class="content">thanks for the reply nem Since posting this morning I have been trying the different
								settings as you describe but unfortunatly with out much sucess. the best setting still seems to be with
								no mipmaps. the basic quality of the texture seems prety good and is of a large enough size (256 x
								256).<br />
								once in game with mip maps on the patern looks ok if you are close to it but as you look further down
								the length of the wall it looks more and more blurd.<br />
								<br />
								A friend of mine has had this problem and went over to using photo shop to make his textures but I dont
								have photo shop and that meathod seems much more complicated.<br />
								Per haps if the mipmaps were reduced from the 9 that it creates to say 1 2 or 3 it might look
								different.<br />
								<br />
								PS .. my understanding of mipmaps was to use a lower resolution texture as you moved further away from
								the textured object so as to use les computer rescources and aid FPS ????</div>

							<div class="content">If your mapping for a game that uses a more recent version of the .vtf format, you
								can include a <i>LOD Control Resource</i> which can be used to limit the number of mipmaps used. To use
								this feature, make sure your .vtf version is 7.3 or above (Advanced tab) then enable the resource under
								the resources tab.<br /><br />Resizing images is not only an expensive task, but it is a very difficult
								task to do with good results. The purpose of mipmaps is to provide the rendering engine with a series of
								high quality resized versions of the original. This way, when the engine gos to fill a polygon, it is
								more likely to have a high quality texture of roughly the same size as the polygon.<br /><br />Mipmaps
								don't stop the engine from resizing, however. The engine will typically choose the two textures closest
								in size then interpolate to get the best approximation. There are different types of interpolation
								methods, but the best are very expensive (so you're not really saving anything by having smaller
								textures far away because (1) you're using more than one texture and (2) your doing several
								interpolations instead of just one).<br /><br />An excellent description of the different ways mipmaps
								are used is described <a
									href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170904164308/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_filtering">here</a>.<br />

								Perhaps if you could provide me with some screenshots of the problems you are having I can provide more

							<div class="content">OK I rhink you might have hit the nail on the head as all my settings were on let the
								aplication decide but they are all using trilinear, But I have just found that if I up my setting for
								this to 16x it seems to be much better.in hammer and in the game.<br />
								I am not the only one to see this problem as now that I have pointed it out to him, SADIST (another well
								known mapper for Hl2 Death-Match ) can also see this problem.<br />
								<br />
								I will see if I van get sadist to try this out tonight as well .<br />
								<br />
								Ps my wifes pc has the same game on it and her setting is only at trilinear but looks great on the
								screen but she is using an old ati 1950 pro GPU and i know that there are quite allot of differences
								between ATI and Nvidia.<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								EDIT..... Just spent a bit of time testing this and yes you are definatly right it is the Anisotropic
								filtering but it only fixes it if i change the gpu setting for this to 16x...<br />
								<br />
								Many thanks for your time on this for me .....<br />

								<br />
								Most recent mid-range video cards should be able to handle 16x anisotropic texture filtering with

							<div class="content">I cooked up a method to create recursive vmt files customized to whatever you want.
								You can use batch file commands to parse for the text you want and replace it but its been a decade
								since I used this kind of technique and can't remember how.<br />
								<br />
								To create new vmt files you must first delete the old ones if there are any. Then in in your base
								materials directory create these two files master.bat and function.bat.<br />
								<br />
								Open master.bat and insert this code<br />
								<br />
								for /r %%f in (*.vtf) do call function.bat %%~nf<br />
								<br />
								then inside function.bat insert this code<br />
								<br />
								@echo off&amp;setlocal enableextensions<br />
								<br />
								for %%* in (.) do set MyDir=%%~n*<br />
								<br />
								if not defined MyDir set MyDir=%CD:\=%<br />
								<br />
								echo &quot;LightmappedGeneric&quot; &gt;&gt; %1<br />
								echo { &gt;&gt; %1<br />
								<br />
								echo &quot;$basetexture&quot; &quot;%MYDIR%\%1&quot; &gt;&gt; %1<br />
								echo } &gt;&gt; %1<br />
								ren *. *.vmt<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								the bits of code that start echo and end &gt;&gt; %1 are the lines where you decide what gets added into
								the vmt. The format is straight forward<br />
								echo codetobeinserted &gt;&gt; %1<br />
								If it requires &quot;&quot; just add them, no special parsing stuff, it adds literally whatever you
								type.<br />
								Master.bat looks for any vtf file in the directory where you run the batch then sends each one's name to
								the function.bat file. Function takes the name and creates a file with the same name. It then inserts
								the code you told it to and finally renames all the files to .vmt. After it finishes the directory its
								in it goes through every sub-directory until it can't find any more vtf files. <br />
								These bat files will keep the directory structure for all vtf in all sub directories but you may have to
								edit the ones in the base directory because it sometimes puts in /material/texture instead of just
								texture...<br />
								Hope this is helpful! I had the problem of having my copy of vtfedit add in translucent on all my vmt
								when i converted a folder. I also needed to add in comments to certain folders' vmt files for my own
								purposes.</div>

							<div class="content">There's no justifying the design of this library. I wrote it almost 10 years ago when
								I was still fairly new to programming, and I don't think the Source engine was even multithreaded at the
								time (if I remember correctly, the Athlon 64 X2 had just came out). The design was loosely based on
								other popular libraries out around then. Since that time it has mostly only been updated when the VTF
								format has changed.<br />
								<br />
								If it ever gets refactored, it might be to remove its dependency on the old deprecated NXDXT library. I
								doubt I'll ever get around to it though.<br />
								<br />

							<div class="content">Btw. there seems to be a replacement for the NXDXT
								library:<br />http://people.freedesktop.org/~cbrill/libtxc_dxtn/<br /><br />Under Fedora I can install
								that with &quot;sudo yum install libtxc_dxtn&quot;. :)<br /><br /><br />I tried to keep binary
								compatibility when compiled for Windows, but I haven't even tried to compile it for Windows. I would
								only cross-compile it with MinGW anyway. My Linux port theoretically supports Files &gt; 4 GB
								(-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE make off_t 64bit and bring fseeko and ftello into existence,
								even under 32bit Linux), if the VTF format would support that. I replaced vlUInt and vlLong with vlSSize
								(&quot;stream size&quot;), vlSize and vlOffset. Under Windows it should typdef to the same as before,
								under Linux vlSSize = off_t (signed 64bit), vlSize = size_t (unsigned 32bit or 64bit) and vlOffset =
								off_t. This means under Windows vlSSize is unsigned and under Linux it is signed. Maybe that is not such
								a good idea. vlSSize has to be off_t (or something that is at least as big) because that is the type of
								the st_size field in the stat struct. If functions that return vlSSize fail they return -1 in Linux and
								0 in Windows. I think THAT cannot be and I have to change it to 0 everywhere, even though 0 could be a
								valid value. Or maybe make it vlUInt64 under Windows and also return -1 there (which would break
								compatibility)? (I just now changed it to 0 everywhere and pushed to github.)<br /><br />Btw. I also
								wrote a Qt4 QImageIO plugin based on this:<br /><a
									href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170905163811/https://github.com/panzi/qvtf">https://github.com/panzi/qvtf</a><br />
								<br />
								Next: A KDE plugin, because apparently some (the most important) KDE applications ignore the Qt QImageIO
								plugin infrastructure and use their own. GIMP also ignores the GDK PixBuf loader infrastructure. Bah.
